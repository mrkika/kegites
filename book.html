          <h2>Chapter 2:<br> Origin of the Club</h2>
          <p>
            The Kegites Club is the most popular socio-cultural club in Nigeria. Supreme Comradium can be traced to thirteen
            students of the then Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, who gathered themselves every evening to
            relax
            after studies.The thirteen students became the executive and periodically they donated Palm Wine in turns for the
            consumption of the group. Not before long, history was made as they became founding members of this wonderful club
            “The
            Kegites Club”. All this occurred while they were at the Ibadan Campus before they were moved to the permanent site
            in
            Ile- Ife. <br><br>The Club was founded in 1962 at the University of Ife(now Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife) by
            these
            visionary students, to promote African heritage and unity. The Palm Wine Drinkers Club as they were first called;
            did
            not only come into existence by accident but by incidence. The club had its first Chief in the person of Late Prof.
            Olusegun Adesina. The Club been a socio-cultural club; members agreed that he should be called Chief as in
            traditional
            African setting. Thus, Chief Olusegun Adesina was the first Chief to be coronated in 1963.<br><br> Since the
            formation of
            the
            club, it has undergone various kinds of transformation, for instance; the Club had its first Female Member in 1968
            in
            the person of L.S.F Dupe Ajayi and in 1974 the Club spread to other institutions of higher learning across Nigeria
            with
            Ilya du Tractor(Federal College of Agriculture, Akure, Ondo State, Nigeria) as the first Ilya to get a Keg of
            Office(Accreditation) from the World Headquarters, Ile Ife; followed by University of Ibadan which is known as
            National
            Headquarters. The Club changed its name on October 1986, during the reign of Chief Anthony Uzodinma Ogidi, the then
            World Chief, at the World Chiefsis Conference of 1986, from Palm Wine Drinkers Club to Kegites Club International
            and
            the Motto was changed from The Basis of African Peace to Unity in Diversity.<br><br> From inception, Kegites Club
            has
            remained
            one Supreme Club with branches (Ilyasis) in almost all institutions of higher learning both in Nigeria and other
            parts
            of the world. As at this day, there are over 100 Ilyasis in Nigeria and Overseas. Ilyasis outside Nigeria
            include(but
            not limited to) United Kingdom(Ilya du Queen), Chicago, USA(Ilya du Windy), India(Ilya du Punjab) and more. The
            Kegites
            Club International is one and indivisible. Supremost Comradium has a special language with a peculiar dialectical
            parlance which every member is delighted to speak at all times and gatherings.

        <p>
          Imbibe Imbibe in Majesty<br>
          Holy Water is good for me<br>
          Holy Water from Kegites Tree<br>

        <h2>Our Motto Still Remains</h2>
        <p>
          Unity in Diversity
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Origin</h2>
        <p>
          The Kegites Club is the most popular socio-cultural club in Nigeria.<br> Supreme Comradium can be traced to thirteen students of the then Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, who
          gathered themselves every evening to relax after studies. The thirteen students became the executive and periodically
          they donated Palm Wine in turns for the consumption of the group. Not before long, history was made as they became
          founding members of this wonderful club “The Kegites Club”. All this occurred while they were at the Ibadan Campus
          before they were moved to the permanent site in Ile-Ife. The Club was founded in 1962 at the University of
          Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University) by these visionary students to promote African heritage and unity. The Palm Wine Drinkers Club as they were first called; did not only come into existence by accident but by incidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The club had its first Chief in the person of Late of Prof. Olusegun Adesina. The Club been a socio-cultural club; it was agreed that he should be called Chief as in African traditional setting. Thus, Chief
          Olusegun Adesina was the first Chief to be coronated in 1963. Since the formation of the club, it has
          undergone various kinds
          of transformation, for instance; the Club had its first Female Member in 1968 in the person of L.S.F Dupe Ajayi and in
          1974 the Club spread to other
          institutions of higher learning across Nigeria with Ilya du Tractor (Federal College of Agriculture, Akure, Ondo
          State, Nigeria) as the first
          Ilya to get a Keg of Office (Accreditation) from the World Headquarters. Ile Ife, followed by University of Ibadan which is known as National Headquarters
          <br>The Club changed its name on October 1986, during the reign of Chief Anthony Uzodima Ogidi, the then world Chief, at the
          <strong>World Chiefsis Conference of 1986 from Palm Wine Drinkers Club to Kegites Club International and the Motto was changed from "The Basis
            of African Peace" to "Unity in Diversity".</strong><br>
          From inception, Kegites Club has
          remained one Supreme
          Club with branches (Ilyasis) in almost all institutions of hiher learning both in Nigeria and other parts of the
          world. As at this day, table-headerare over 100
          Ilyasis in Nigeria and Overseas. Ilyasis outside Nigeria include (but not limited to) United Kingdom (Ilya du Queen),
          Chicago, USA (Ilya du Windy),
          India (Ilya du Punjab) and more. The kegites club international is one and indivisible. The supremost comradium has a special language with a peculiar
          dialectical parlance which every member is delighted to speak at all times and gatherings.

          resuscitate the cultural awareness of our fore fathers and promote honest living and truth among all members as well as
